# GSERM St.Gallen 2019 - Applied Deep Learning in Python

This repository is a partial fulfillment for the completion of GSERM St.Gallen 2019 "Applied Deep Learning in Python" course.
The reflection paper can be found [here](https://github.com/iomz/gserm19-adl/releases/download/v1/GSERM_19_Applied_Deep_Learning_in_Python.pdf).

## Overview

`Explain your data, problem, and what you want to predict (also unsupervised problem is possible)`

This project developed an object detection deep learning model to provide a classifier of artefacts in a video streaming from [ZED stereo camera](https://www.stereolabs.com/zed/).
Previously, I have been working on a Fault Detection \& Diagnosis Mixed Reality application for industrial settings such as manufacture assembly automation with robot arms.

This application assumed that the spatial coordinates of artefacts that the robot interacts with can be tracked by a means of Computer Vision, but was never implemented and has been deployed with synthetic data generated by the monitoring system.
I was inspired by [YOLOv3](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) introduced during the course and decided to implement the missing component by combining YOLO with the ZED stereo camera to translate the inferred object bounding box's coordinates for my Mixed Reality application to achieve a more realistically aligned methodology.

`Define approach: Why did you choose this model? Does the model fit your problem?`

## 0. Setup

To fully reproduce the results from this project, you need a local environment. This sections explains how to setup a development environment on [NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-agx-xavier-developer-kit).



## 1. Get your data

## 5. Evaluate

`Evaluate the outcome: Make sure to cover overfitting. Did it learn the problem? Did it generalize?`

## 6. Modify + Repeat

`How can you improve it? Log all the experiments (it would be optimal to create new files for bigger changes like using a completely different model) and using comments and editing changes in the same file for smaller changes.`

`Why did you chose to modify what? Quality of answer is important.`
