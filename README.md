## Structure

1. Get your data
2. Prepare your data
3. Define and build the model
4. Train
5. Evaluate
6. Modify + Repeat

## Explain your data, problem, and what you want to predict (also unsupervised problem is possible)

## Define approach: Why did you choose this model? Does the model fit your problem?

## Evaluate the outcome: Make sure to cover overfitting. Did it learn the problem? Did it generalize?

## How can you improve it? Log all the experiments (it would be optimal to create new files for bigger changes like using a completely different model) and using comments and editing changes in the same file for smaller changes.

## Why did you chose to modify what? Quality of answer is important.

## You can also try "creative" things and make a guess.

## Do not just stick to the simple hyper-parameters (dropout rate, learning rate, ...) but try exploring different kinds of networks and note how they perform against each other.
